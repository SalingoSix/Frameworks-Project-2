Project by Alex Medos and Emre Aydin

Code should run in Debug 32bit mode

If you want to run any more tests, make sure that each command has a unique command name
after the parameters

Command groups do not have unique names (or names at all)

Make sure there are spaces before and after every bracket

There needs to be a pair of curly brackets around the entire script,
which denotes the "master" command group. Missing it will cause a crash
